        <p>Expenses related to hospital stays, cancer treatments with high-cost <br>

           to the brink of experiencing hard times. Insurance plans are not enough, as <br>
           policies do not cover everything you need.</p>

              <div> <h2>High Cost Of Treatment</h2>
                <p>Medical emergencies come without a warning. At times, health <br>
                   insurance and savings are not enough to cover the expensive bill. <br> 
                   Crowdfunding helps you reach your goal by getting small<br>
                   donations from a large group of people.</p></div>
            
               <div><h2>Asking For Money Isn’t Easy</h2>
                 <p>When in need, asking for help from people and describing <br>
                   financial problems face-to-face can be awkward and inconvenient. <br>
                   Online crowdfunding makes the process of asking for <br>
                   money easier and way more seamless.</p></div>

                   <div><h2>Emergencies Demand A Prompt Response</h2>
                    <p>When your loved ones are diagnosed with life threatening<br>
                       diseases, it’s overwhelming emotionally as well as financially. <br>
                       Most medical emergencies require the treatment to start at the <br>
                       earliest. By giving you a platform to share your emergency,<br>
                      online crowdfunding helps you gather funds quickly.</p></div>

                      <div><h2>Loan Repayment Is Stressful</h2>
                        <p>Getting drowned in personal loans is very common in times of<br>
                         medical emergencies. Once the money is gathered, repaying that <br>
                         loan may take months, sometimes years together. Online <br>
                         crowdfunding comes without debts.</p></div><br>
