            <h2 id="head">Why Do Numerous Individuals, NGOs and<br> Organisations Start Crowdfunding For <br>Animals?
            </h2>
            <div class="cont">
                <div> <h2>Cost Of Pet Surgery & Treatment Is Very High</h2>
                  <p>In India, Animals don't get medical insurance like us humans.<br>
                     However, when our pets fall ill and require immediate medical <br>
                     care, our savings are not enough to cover the expensive surgery <br>
                     and treatment costs. By starting an Animal Crowdfunding, pet<br>
                     owners can receive small donations from a large group of people<br>
                     and ensure their pets get the needed medical care.</p></div>

                     <div><h2>Volunteers Of Animal Shelters Are Unable To <br>Get Adequate Funds</h2>
                        <p>Most animal shelters require constant financial help to provide <br>
                           food and primary healthcare facilities. However, the number of<br> 
                           individuals volunteering at shelters is very low. Hence, they have<br>
                           to dedicate every moment to caring for the animals. Starting an<br>
                           animal crowdfunding campaign to support the animal shelter <br>
                           allows them to use social media and the power of the <br>
                           internet to raise awareness and get funding.</p></div>

                      <div><h2>Rescuing And Rehabilitation Are Expensive</h2>
                        <p>Saving abandoned animals, rescuing injured and helpless<br> 
                          animals require different types of equipment. Similarly,<br> 
                          providing these animals with a haven and treating their injuries<br>
                          is expensive. Rehabilitation is costly, and the groups that <br>
                          conduct such activities are very few. Therefore, we urge <br>
                          rescue groups to start a crowdfunding campaign for animals on <br>
                          GrowMore to ensure all their expenses can be taken care of<br>
                          through fundraising online for such causes.</p></div>

                               ecosystems of global importance. They need to collaborate with <br>
